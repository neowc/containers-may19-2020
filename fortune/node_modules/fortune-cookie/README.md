# Fortune Cookie

```bash
npm install fortune-cookie --save
```

A collection of fortune cookie fortunes. I hand typed out each fortune from my personal fortune cookie collection that I've had since childhood. I'd love people to take this and create anything they want with it. I find it interesting that the most used word in all of the text is `you` and not `the`.
